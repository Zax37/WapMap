## Info

WapMap is a fanmade WAP32 file editor, originally developped by kijanek6 in 2010-2013.
It's mostly known as Claw level editor, but it also supports Gruntz and Get Medieval maps (to some extent).

For the 10th birthday of the editor, I decided to bring it back - starting with bugfixes, then adding some new features,
and finally doing a full redesign.

WapMap, as most of kijanek's projects at the time, depended on HGE(Haaf's Game Engine), which he edited when needed.
Sadly, in the package, which I got from him, there was no source files of that version, only linking files, but bit
after bit, I managed to re-implement most of his changes.

At some point WapMap was meant to be partially rewritten with the usage of SFML, but kijanek failed to
get it working and abandoned the project. I was considering doing it, but it would probably be easier to
rewrite the whole thing then, and I decided not to do that, but keep my legacy alive.

## Building

1. Get Visual Studio 2017 (v141) toolset to build HGE and 2019 (v142) for WapMap.

2. Create some directory for the project and its dependencies (e.g. WapMap).

3. Clone them:

```
git clone https://github.com/Zax37/WapMap
git clone https://github.com/Zax37/hge
git clone https://github.com/curl/curl
git clone https://github.com/lua/lua
```

4. Build the dependencies (I used CMake). You'll need to download DirectX 9 SDK (June 2010), as HGE's readme says.

5. Download [SFML 2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-windows-vc15-32-bit.zip), unzip it
next to other dependencies and rename from `SFML-2.5.1` to `SFML-2.5.1-2017`.

6. Open WapMap/WapMap/WapMap.sln in Visual Studio 2019 and run it!

7. I've also created CMakeLists for the project, if you'd like to use different toolset. I'll try to keep them up to date. :)
