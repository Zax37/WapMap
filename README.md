# WapMap

## Info

WapMap is a fanmade WAP32 file editor, originally developped by kijanek6 in 2010-2013.
It's mostly known as Claw level editor, but it used to support Gruntz and Get Medieval maps too at some point(and to some extent).

For the upcoming, 10th birthday of the editor, I decided to bring it back, and finally managed to build the thing myself.

WapMap, as most of kijanek's projects at the time, depended on HGE(Haaf's Game Engine), which he edited when needed.
Sadly, in the package, which I got from him, there was no source files of that version, only linking files.

He planned on rewriting the rendering to SFML, but he failed to get it working and abandoned the project.

## Building

1. Get Visual Studio 2017 (HGE won't build in 2019 from what I've seen).

2. Create some directory for the project and its dependencies.

3. Clone them:

```
git clone https://github.com/Zax37/WapMap
git clone https://github.com/kvakvs/hge
git clone https://github.com/curl/curl
git clone https://github.com/lua/lua
```

4. Build the dependencies (I used CMake).

5. Download [SFML 2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-windows-vc15-32-bit.zip), unzip it next to other dependencies and rename from `SFML-2.5.1` to `SFML-2.5.1-2017`.

6. Open WapMap/WapMap/WapMap.sln in Visual Studio 2017 and run it!
